# Experiment_Washer
## A Few Things to Know
### 1. This is a Naive basic frame of our Android App. The core reservation function is not implemented
### 2. The Database configuration is connected to my personal database on AWS. If you want to do experiments by yourself, Please change the configurations in 
### app\src\main\java\com\laioffer\dryer\database\MySQLDBUtil.java and lib\src\main\java\com\laioffer\lib\MySQLDBUtil.java
### 3. The lib module is not necessary. It is just some instant java main functions because sometimes I want to directly manipulate database and some operations may not support by MySQL Workbench
